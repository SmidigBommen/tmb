## 5. ROUTE VARIANTS AND ALTERNATIVES

### Classic Counter-Clockwise vs. Clockwise

| Factor | Counter-Clockwise (Classic) | Clockwise |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------|
| **Popularity** | ~90% of hikers | ~10% of hikers |
| **Signage** | Best marked; all guidebooks follow this direction | Adequate but less intuitive |
| **Difficulty Progression** | Starts with challenging stages | Starts easier, builds to harder stages |
| **Crowd Experience** | Hiking with the majority | Mostly solitude; pass other hikers briefly mid-day |
| **Key View Advantage** | Grand Balcon Sud facing Mont Blanc; Italian approach to Col de la Seigne | Fenetre d'Arpette approach with Trient Glacier views; Grand Col Ferret descent with Mont Blanc views |
| **Elevation Savings** | Can avoid ~1,602 m of ascent via cable cars/shortcuts (~15% of total) | Can avoid ~1,480 m of ascent |
| **Best For** | First-timers; those wanting well-documented route | Experienced hikers; those seeking solitude; repeat hikers |

### Key Decision Points (Variants)

#### 1. Col de Tricot vs. Standard Route (Stage 1)
- **Standard:** Via Col de Voza - easier, more road walking
- **Variant:** Via Col de Tricot (2,120 m) - more challenging but far more scenic
  - Crosses the Bionnassay Himalayan suspension bridge
  - Direct views of Bionnassay Glacier
  - Can combine with Bellevue Cable Car to reduce effort
  - Adds ~200 m more elevation gain

## 6. SAFETY INFORMATION

### Emergency Contacts

| Service | Number | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **European Emergency Number** | **112** | Works in all three countries (France, Italy, Switzerland) |
| **Swiss Emergency** | **114** | Alternative for Switzerland specifically |
| **PGHM Chamonix** (Peloton de Gendarmerie de Haute-Montagne) | +33 4 50 53 16 89 | Primary mountain rescue for Mont Blanc massif area |
| **Mountain Rescue (France)** | 112 or 15 (SAMU) | Helicopter rescue available |
| **Mountain Rescue (Italy)** | 112 or 118 | Soccorso Alpino |
| **Mountain Rescue (Switzerland)** | 1414 (REGA) | Swiss air rescue |
| **La Chamoniarde** | +33 4 50 53 22 08 | Chamonix mountain safety office (trail info, conditions) |

**Rescue Response Time:** Average 17 minutes (with 7-minute variance). In 70% of cases, a physician is included in the rescue team.

**When Calling Emergency:**
- Provide exact GPS coordinates if possible
- Path number and area name
- Describe weather conditions
- Report whether the area is safe for helicopter landing
- Helicopter landing zone: minimum 25 m x 25 m, free of obstacles
- Stay still and kneel when helicopter approaches

### Common Hazards

1. **Weather:** Rapid changes; afternoon thunderstorms; lightning at altitude; can experience all four seasons in one day
2. **Snow and Ice:** Early season (June-early July) snow on passes; collapsing snow bridges; sliding on frozen snow
3. **Rockfall:** Rare but dangerous, particularly in rocky sections
4. **Steep Terrain:** Relentless descents causing knee strain; ladders on Stages 10-11
5. **Heat and Sun:** Strong UV at altitude; dehydration; heat exhaustion in valleys
6. **Stream Crossings:** Water levels can rise rapidly after rain
7. **Navigation in Fog:** Trail markers obscured; GPS essential as backup
8. **Wildlife:** Ibex and chamois can startle hikers on narrow trails (not aggressive but proximity on narrow ledges can be startling)
9. **Overexertion:** Daily cumulative fatigue over 10+ days; pushing too hard in early stages

### Weather Considerations

- **Check forecasts daily:** Use Meteo France, MeteoSwiss, or ARPA Valle d'Aosta
- **Start early:** Aim to cross passes before noon to avoid afternoon storms
- **Lightning protocol:** If caught in a storm, descend from ridges and summits; avoid metal objects; crouch low if needed
- **Temperature range:** Can swing 10-15 C between valley and pass in a single day
- **Visibility:** Fog can roll in quickly at altitude, obscuring trail markers

### Altitude Concerns

- **Maximum altitude (classic):** ~2,537 m (Grand Col Ferret)
- **Maximum altitude (with variants):** ~2,665 m (Col des Fours / Fenetre d'Arpette)
- **Altitude sickness risk:** LOW - the TMB does not reach altitudes where acute mountain sickness is typically a concern (generally above 3,000 m)
- **However:** Mild symptoms (headaches, fatigue, slight dizziness) can occur, especially on first days at altitude
- **Note:** Higher elevation causes increased fatigue, which can impair judgment and decision-making
- **No acclimatization schedule needed** for the TMB (unlike high-altitude treks)

### Mobile Phone Coverage

- Generally good in valleys and near towns
- **Very poor or non-existent** between: Courmayeur to Les Chapieux and Les Chapieux to Les Contamines
- Carry offline maps downloaded before departure
- Some refuges have WiFi but do not count on it

## 7. THREE COUNTRIES: BORDER AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION

### Border Crossing Points

| Border | Location | Altitude | Between Stages |
|--------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **France to Italy** | Col de la Seigne | 2,516 m | Stage 3 |
| **Italy to Switzerland** | Grand Col Ferret | 2,537 m | Stage 6 |
| **Switzerland to France** | Col de Balme | 2,131 m | Stage 9 |

**Border Controls:** None. All three countries are in the Schengen Area. No passport checks at borders, though carrying a passport/ID is recommended (and legally required in some of these countries).

### Currency

| Country | Currency | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **France** | Euro (EUR) | Standard in all establishments |
| **Italy** | Euro (EUR) | Standard in all establishments; generally cheapest prices of the three countries |
| **Switzerland** | Swiss Franc (CHF) | Official currency; **however, most TMB establishments near the border accept Euros** (potentially at unfavorable exchange rate). Cards increasingly accepted. |

**Practical Tips:**
- You CAN hike the entire TMB using only Euros, but you may lose money on exchange at Swiss huts
- Carry CHF 100-200 in cash for the Swiss section (3-4 nights)
- ATMs available in Courmayeur, Champex-Lac, and Chamonix
- Many mountain refuges prefer or require cash (especially in France and Italy)
- Credit cards increasingly accepted in towns but not always at remote refuges

### Language Tips

| Country | Official Language | English Proficiency | Key Phrases |
|---------|------------------|--------------------|----|
| **France** | French | Moderate in tourist areas; limited at remote refuges | Bonjour (hello), Merci (thank you), S'il vous plait (please), Refuge (mountain hut), Eau (water), Sentier (trail), Col (mountain pass), Orage (thunderstorm) |
| **Italy** | Italian | Moderate in Courmayeur; limited elsewhere | Buongiorno (hello), Grazie (thank you), Per favore (please), Rifugio (mountain hut), Acqua (water), Sentiero (trail), Colle (mountain pass) |
| **Switzerland** | French (in Valais region traversed by TMB) | Good | Same French phrases as France. Swiss section is French-speaking (not German or Italian). |

**Note:** The Swiss section the TMB traverses (Canton Valais) is French-speaking, so French is useful for both the French and Swiss portions of the trek.

### Country-Specific Trail Markings

| Country | Marking System |
|---------|---------------|
| **France** | Red and white horizontal stripes (GR trail markings) |
| **Italy** | Red and white stripes; also yellow background with black directional marks in valleys |
| **Switzerland** | Yellow diamond signs with red-white-red markers; yellow background with black diamond in valleys. Swiss signage is generally considered the clearest and most comprehensive. |

### Country-Specific Notes

**France (Stages 1-3 and 9-11):**
- French alpine huts serve hearty meals; expect multi-course dinners
- Showers often charged separately (EUR 2-4)
- Many refuges cash-only
- National reserve areas (Contamines-Montjoie): stay on marked trails

**Italy (Stages 3-6):**
- Generally the most affordable section
- Italian rifugios often include showers in the price
- Courmayeur: excellent Italian food, gelato, shopping
- Espresso culture - great coffee at every stop
- Val d'Aosta has its own regional identity (bilingual French/Italian)

**Switzerland (Stages 6-9):**
- Most expensive section (prices 20-40% higher than France/Italy)
- Excellent trail infrastructure and signage
- Swiss efficiency in hut management
- Swiss chocolate and cheese specialties at huts (raclette at Alpage de la Peule)
- Very clean and well-maintained trails
